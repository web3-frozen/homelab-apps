# Infisical config for direct SDK access
# The infisical-machine-identity Secret and infisical-config ConfigMap
# are managed by Pulumi (platform_layer/__init__.py) — NOT defined here.
#
# The backend reads INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID, INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET, and
# INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID from these resources and fetches secrets directly
# from Infisical at startup via the Go SDK.
